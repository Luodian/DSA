You have created the threading tree.
		     A                                                                                                                          

		   B    C                                                                                                                       

		 D  E F  G                                                                                                                      

		H I    J                                                                                                                        


Please input node you want to search:In Preorder the node after A is :B

Please input node you want to search:In Inorder the node after B is :E

Please input node you want to search:In Postorder the node after F is :G

Now I will show you three different ways of traversal according to inthreads

First the preorder is: ABDHIECFJG

Second the inorder is: HDIBEAFJCG

Third the postorder is: EBJFGCA
